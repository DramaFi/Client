# AI Drama Betting Game - Frontend

## Overview
The AI Drama Betting Game is a decentralized platform where players engage in AI-generated social media controversies. Users predict drama outcomes, place bets using Reaction NFTs (ðŸ˜‚, ðŸ˜±, ðŸš€), and can influence events by paying tokens to "boost" specific actions. AI determines the final results based on user interactions, interventions, and predefined probability rules.

## Features
- **AI-Generated Social Media Dramas**: The platform creates influencers and scenarios based on real-world cultural trends.
- **Bet with Reaction NFTs**: Players choose how they think the controversy will end by using special NFTs.
- **Boost Mechanics**: Players can pay tokens to escalate the drama (e.g., leak fake DMs, buy followers).
- **Fair AI-Driven Outcome System**: AI calculates the final result based on bets, boosts, and randomness.
- **Reward System**: Winning bets split the prize pool.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Next.js / Vite)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS / shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: Redux / Context API
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (for NFT transactions and betting logic)
- **Backend (if needed)**: Node.js with Express or a decentralized storage system like IPFS and AI agents using gaia, auth using privy
